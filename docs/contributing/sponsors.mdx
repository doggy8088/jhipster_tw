JHipster uses [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/generator-jhipster) to gather money. This money is used to cover project expenses (like running this website) in a transparent way ([See the Open Collective documentation](https://opencollective.com/how-it-works)), and your donation will help the project live and grow successfully.

Please go to our [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/generator-jhipster) to become a backer or a sponsor.

## Disclaimer

This is a donation. No goods or services are expected in return. Any requests for refunds for those purposes will be rejected.

We are a French non-profit organization, as described in our [status](/association/), and we're not interested in business partnerships.

## Benefits of being a backer

Backers donate $2 per month to the project.

We use the Open Collective APIs to automatically display backers on our main page:

- On the GitHub main project page in the "backers" section (about 15,000 views/month).

## What will the project do with the money?

As you can read in [the Open Collective documentation](https://docs.opencollective.com), the way your money will be used will be public and totally transparent.

Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.

Money will first be used to cover direct project costs:

- [Bug bounties](/bug-bounties)
- Website hosting
- Developer tooling
- Legal protection

Then, money will be used to:

- Pay for project goodies
- Pay Meetup fees
- Pay expenses for developer gatherings: travel & food expenses for core team meetings

## Help! I'm a sponsor and my logo doesn't appear!

For each sponsorship level, we use the Open Collective APIs to automatically display sponsors on our main page. So if your logo doesn't appear:

- Check that you selected a correct sponsorship tier. This needs to be one of the tiers listed above, not a custom contribution.
- Check your Open Collective profile to ensure that your logo is uploaded: this is what we'll use to automatically display your logo on our main page.
- Wait a few minutes: the Open Collective APIs are cached, so it might take a few minutes for your logo to appear.

If those steps don't work, please contact Open Collective support, as we don't have control over their APIs. They might have a bug or a technical issue that they need to fix.

And please remember the disclaimer at the top of this page: "This is a donation. No goods or services are expected in return. Any requests for refunds for those purposes will be rejected.".
