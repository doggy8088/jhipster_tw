JHipster release 1.0.0
==================

*JHipster为您提供集Yeoman + Maven + Spring + AngularJS于一体的应用生成器.*

更新日志
----------

JHipster has now reached its 1.0.0 version.

This 1.0.0 release is mostly a stable, fine-tuned version of our latest 0.18.1 release. It has been tested for more than 1 month and we have corrected [lots of minor bugs](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A1.0+is%3Aclosed).

What an incredible journey it has been! In just 10 months, the project has reached 753 stars, 169 forks and 48 contributors on GitHub. We have reports of tens of projects using JHipster, all over the world (the project is now translated in 11 different languages!).

For our next minor releases we will still focus on stability and compatibility between all the options that are provided by JHipster. We have found very useful to have the same workflow and project structure, whereas you use Maven/Grunt/MySQL or Gradle/Gulp.js/MongoDB/Atmosphere. This allows different teams and projects to work better together.

Thank you to all our contributors and users! If you like our project, please give us a star on GitHub, and follow us on Twitter!
