JHipster release 3.9.0
==================

更新日志
----------

Lots of new exciting features in this release, as well as the usual bug fixes. Here are the most important ones:

- The "upgrade" sub-generator had issues since Git v2.9.0. You will probably need this when upgrading to this new JHipster release! See [#4253](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/4253)
- Consul support is now available for microservices architecture. This gives a second option, in replacement from the JHipster Registry (which is based on Eureka). See [#4143](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/4143) [#4165](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/4165)
- The Docker-Compose sub-generator can now work on monoliths (and not just gateways/microservices): [#4267](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/4267)
- New "IDE" Maven profile, to better configure IDEs when using DTOs with MapStruct: [#4118](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/4118)
- Continuous compilation with the Scala Maven Plugin. This isn't fully documented yet, as we are still testing some corner cases. This allows to have the application built automatically from the command line, which is really awesome when used with the Spring Boot devtools and BrowserSync: [#4204](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/4204)
- The generated README file is now much better, and points to the specific JHipster version that was used to generate the project, in our archived documentation. See [#4236](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/4236)
- Upgrade to the latest SpringFox version: [#4279](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/4279)
- Upgrade to the latest Spring Cloud Stream "Brooklyn" release, which allows to use the latest Kafka API version.
- Elasticsearch support in Kubernetes: [#4269](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/4269)

更新指引
------------

For an automatic upgrade, starting with JHipster v3.4.0, use the [JHipster upgrade sub-generator]({{ site.url }}/upgrading-an-application/) on an existing application:

```
yo jhipster:upgrade
```

选择手动升级, 需要先升级你的Jhipster版本:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

如果你已经有了一个项目, 将会继续使用当时项目生成的Jhipster版本.
如果需要升级你的项目, 你需要先删除`node_modules`文件夹再运行:

```
yo jhipster
```

更新你的项目和所有的实体类

```
yo jhipster --with-entities
```

你也可以使用实体类子生成器挨个更新你的实体类, 例如你的实体类名字是_Foo_

```
yo jhipster:entity Foo
```
