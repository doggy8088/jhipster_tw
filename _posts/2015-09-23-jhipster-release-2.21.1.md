This is a bug fixing release, which mainly:

- Fixes issue [#1991](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/1991) : grunt tests where failing when both OAuth2 and WebSockets where selected
- Fixes issue [#2026](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/2026) : Cassandra support was broken because of the new user management system
