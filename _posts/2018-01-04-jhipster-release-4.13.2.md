JHipster release 4.13.2
==================

更新日志
----------

This patch release was triggered because of this issue, as it affects everyone:

- Tests on AuditsComponent fail with Prod profile [#6937](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/6937)

Please note that [we have voted to remove HTTP session clustering with Hazelcast](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/jhipster-dev/A6HabUyZRRY), and that since our last release you can easily configure a Spring Cache abstraction, which we believe gives a much better solution to the same problem. So this is probably the last release with that option enabled.

Our React support is moving quickly forward:

- all administration screens are finished
- simple entities are finished (but relationships are not yet available)

As before, you can test our React support by using the `--experimental` flag when running JHipster.

更新指引
------------

**自动升级**

在已存在的项目上使用[JHipster upgrade sub-generator]({{ site.url }}/upgrading-an-application/)自动升级:

升级Jhipster版本:

```
yarn global upgrade generator-jhipster
```

然后升级子生成器:

```
jhipster upgrade
```

**手动升级**

选择手动升级, 需要先升级你的Jhipster版本:

```
yarn global upgrade generator-jhipster
```

如果你已经有了一个项目, 将会继续使用当时项目生成的Jhipster版本.
如果需要升级你的项目, 你需要先删除`node_modules`文件夹再运行:

```
jhipster
```

更新你的项目和所有的实体类

```
jhipster --with-entities
```

你也可以使用实体类子生成器挨个更新你的实体类, 例如你的实体类名字是_Foo_

```
jhipster entity Foo
```
